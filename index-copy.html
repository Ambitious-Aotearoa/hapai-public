                                        <p>If you are interested in beginning a career in the public sector, there are many ways to start. One of the first steps you can take is to define what area of the public sector you would like to explore. Consider whether you want to work in front-line services or take a more administration-based approach.  </p>
                                        <p>Are you attracted to a particular area of work, like conservation, policing or education? </p>
                                        <p>The public sector spans many roles, disciplines, agencies and professions. What binds them all together is the desire to work in service of the public and improve outcomes for all New Zealanders. Exploring the website of the Public Service Commission Te Kawa Mataaho is a good next step.  </p>
